High level description of the entire system, followed by details about the purpose of each of agents.

### üìù Pseudocode of Task-Driven Autonomous Agent System

By using this pseudocode, each agent can share an understanding of the entire system operation, allowing them to perform their respective tasks effectively and with greater focus.

```python
# Pseudocode for the Task-Driven Autonomous Agent System

# Initialize and configure all agents
task_manager_agent = TaskManagerAgent()
task_executor_agent = TaskExecutorAgent()
memory_manager_agent = MemoryManagerAgent()
execution_context_agent = ExecutionContextAgent()
security_safety_agent = SecuritySafetyAgent()

# Main loop for the system operation
while True:

    # Task Manager Agent generates and prioritizes tasks
    task_manager_agent.generate_and_prioritize_tasks()

    # Task Executor Agent processes the task at the front of the task list
    current_task = task_manager_agent.get_next_task()
    task_executor_agent.process_task(current_task)

    # Memory Manager Agent provides necessary memory and context for task execution
    memory_context = memory_manager_agent.get_memory_context(current_task)
    task_executor_agent.set_memory_context(memory_context)

    # Execution Context Agent interfaces with external environments
    execution_context = execution_context_agent.get_execution_context(current_task)
    task_executor_agent.set_execution_context(execution_context)

    # Task Executor Agent completes the task, stores the result in Pinecone, and updates the Memory Manager Agent
    task_result = task_executor_agent.complete_task(current_task)
    memory_manager_agent.store_task_result(current_task, task_result)

    # Task Manager Agent generates new tasks based on the completed task result and reprioritizes the task list
    new_tasks = task_manager_agent.generate_new_tasks(current_task, task_result)
    task_manager_agent.add_and_prioritize_tasks(new_tasks)

    # Security and Safety Agent monitors and filters content throughout the process
    security_safety_agent.monitor_and_filter_content(current_task, task_result)

    # Check for system termination conditions, such as all tasks completed or a specific goal reached
    if system_termination_condition():
        break
```

The system consists of the following agents and components:

### üìã Task Manager Agent

The Task Manager Agent maintains the task list, generates new tasks based on completed results, and prioritizes tasks in real-time.

#### Initialization of Task Manager Agent

In order to enable the Task Manager Agent to perform its duties effectively in the proposed architecture and examples, the system message should contain the following components:

1. Task ID: A unique identifier for each task in the system, which can be used to track the progress, completion status, and dependencies of tasks.

        return result

    def analyze_task(self, task):
        # Use GPT-4 and LangChain to analyze the task description and requirements
        analysis_result = analyze_with_gpt4_and_langchain(task.task_description)

        # Incorporate memory context and execution context in the analysis
        analysis_result = self.integrate_memory_and_execution_context(analysis_result, self.memory_context, self.execution_context)

        # Update memory manager with the analysis result
        self.memory_context.update_memory(task.task_id, "analysis_result", analysis_result)

        return analysis_result

    def implement_task(self, task):
        # Use GPT-4 and LangChain to generate implementation code or configuration changes
        implementation_result = implement_with_gpt4_and_langchain(task.task_description)

        # Incorporate memory context and execution context in the implementation
        implementation_result = self.integrate_memory_and_execution_context(implementation_result, self.memory_context, self.execution_context)

        # Update memory manager with the implementation result

        result_with_context = update_result_with_context(result, memory_context, execution_context)

        return result_with_context
```

The agent processes tasks based on their type, using GPT-4 and LangChain to analyze, implement, test, and deploy tasks. The agent integrates the memory context and execution context throughout the process, ensuring that the task execution is informed by relevant information and resources. The memory manager is updated with the results at each stage, providing a record of the task progress and outcomes.

### üß† Memory Manager Agent

```python
# Pseudocode for the Memory Manager Agent

# Initialize and configure the Memory Manager Agent
memory_manager_agent = MemoryManagerAgent()
memory_storage = PineconeMemoryStorage()

# Main loop for the Memory Manager Agent operation
while True:

    # Receive a system message with memory-related instructions
    system_message = receive_system_message()

    # Extract necessary information from the system message
    memory_action = system_message["memory_action"]
    memory_key = system_message["memory_key"]
    memory_data = system_message["memory_data"]
    memory_metadata = system_message["memory_metadata"]
    memory_query = system_message["memory_query"]

    # Perform the requested memory action
    if memory_action == "store":
        memory_storage.store(memory_key, memory_data, memory_metadata)

    elif memory_action == "retrieve":
        if memory_query is not None:
            # Retrieve memory items based on the query
            memory_items = memory_storage.retrieve_by_query(memory_query)
        else:
            # Retrieve a single memory item by key
            memory_item = memory_storage.retrieve(memory_key)

    elif memory_action == "update":
        memory_storage.update(memory_key, memory_data, memory_metadata)

    elif memory_action == "delete":
        memory_storage.delete(memory_key)

    # Send a response with the result of the memory action
    send_response(memory_action, memory_key, memory_item)

    # Check for agent termination conditions, such as system shutdown or completion of all tasks
    if agent_termination_condition():
        break
```

The Memory Manager Agent will operate, manage memory items, and interact with the memory storage system (e.g., Pinecone). This will enable it to effectively provide necessary memory and context for task execution, store and retrieve task results, and enforce access controls and data retention policies in the proposed architecture and examples.

### üîí Security and Safety Agent

```python
# Pseudocode for the SecuritySafetyAgent

class SecuritySafetyAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.safety_rules = self.load_safety_rules()

    def load_safety_rules(self):
        # Load safety rules from a predefined source, e.g., a JSON file, a database, etc.
        safety_rules = [
            # Example rules
            {"rule_id": "r1", "rule_description": "Ensure no personally identifiable information (PII) is exposed", "rule_type": "data_privacy"},
            {"rule_id": "r2", "rule_description": "Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines", "rule_type": "ethics"}
        ]
        return safety_rules

    def monitor_and_filter_content(self, current_task, task_result):
        # Apply safety rules on the input and output of the current task
        for rule in self.safety_rules:
            if rule["rule_type"] == "data_privacy":
                self.ensure_data_privacy(current_task, task_result)
            elif rule["rule_type"] == "ethics":
                self.ensure_ethical_compliance(current_task, task_result)

    def ensure_data_privacy(self, current_task, task_result):
        # Implement data privacy checks, such as redacting or anonymizing PII in the task_result
        # This could include checking for email addresses, phone numbers, names, etc.
        task_result = self.redact_pii(task_result)

    def ensure_ethical_compliance(self, current_task, task_result):
        # Implement ethical compliance checks, such as detecting and removing harmful content, biases, or unethical behavior
        # This could include checking for offensive language, fairness, transparency, etc.
        task_result = self.remove_unethical_content(task_result)

    def redact_pii(self, task_result):
        # Implement PII redaction logic, e.g., replacing detected PII with placeholders or anonymized data
        # This is just a simple example, a more sophisticated implementation is needed for real-world use cases
        redacted_task_result = task_result.replace("<email>", "[REDACTED_EMAIL]")
        return redacted_task_result

    def remove_unethical_content(self, task_result):
        # Implement unethical content removal logic, e.g., filtering out offensive language, ensuring fairness, etc.
        # This is just a simple example, a more sophisticated implementation is needed for real-world use cases
        cleaned_task_result = task_result.replace("<offensive_term>", "[REMOVED]")
        return cleaned_task_result

# Example usage of the SecuritySafetyAgent
security_safety_agent = SecuritySafetyAgent()
security_safety_agent.monitor_and_filter_content(current_task, task_result)
```

By using this pseudocode within the system message of the SecuritySafetyAgent, it will have a better understanding of how to monitor and filter content, ensuring that the input and output generated by the system adhere to ethical and safety guidelines.

## Examples of the system in action

### üéõÔ∏è Example of task execution (add chat box)

Task: "Add a chat box to my application and the chat box should be used to be able to interact with our customer services agents."

#### Task execution

When you provide the task to the system, it would progress through several steps involving the different agents to complete it. Here's an outline of the process:

1. Task Manager Agent: The Task Manager Agent receives the new task, which is to add a chat box to your application for interaction with customer service agents. It adds this task to the task list and prioritizes it according to the current list of tasks.

2. Task Executor Agent: The Task Executor Agent processes the task at the front of the task list, which is the chat box implementation task. It would use GPT-4 and the LangChain framework to understand the requirements and generate an implementation plan, such as determining the necessary UI components, backend services, and communication protocols for the chat box.

3. Memory Manager Agent: The Memory Manager Agent provides the necessary memory and context for the task execution. It might retrieve any relevant information stored in Pinecone, such as previous interactions with your application, existing customer service channels, or any prior chat box implementations.

4. Execution Context Agent: The Execution Context Agent interfaces with the external execution environments, such as your application's codebase, APIs, and any required libraries or frameworks. It would access and manage the file system to read and modify the application's code, data, or configuration files, as well as interface with APIs to fetch data or trigger actions based on the task requirements.

5. Task Executor Agent (Continued): With the necessary context, memory, and execution environment, the Task Executor Agent generates the appropriate code and configuration changes for implementing the chat box in your application. It might create new UI components, set up backend services, and establish communication protocols between the chat box and customer service agents.

6. Security and Safety Agent: Throughout the process, the Security and Safety Agent monitors and filters the content generated by the system to ensure that the implementation adheres to ethical and safety guidelines, as well as adhering to any data privacy and security measures necessary for protecting sensitive information.

7. Task Manager Agent (Continued): Once the chat box implementation task is completed, the Task Manager Agent generates new tasks based on the completed task result, such as testing the chat box functionality or integrating it with existing customer service tools. These new tasks are prioritized and added to the task list.

The system iteratively works through these steps until the chat box is successfully implemented in your application and all follow-up tasks are completed.

### üîß More advanced example¬†of task execution (provide fix for problem in production)

Task: "Use the output from a Sentry stack trace from a production system where of an application experienced an unexpected error and provide a fix for the issue as a GitHub pull request."

#### Task execution

When you provide the task to analyze a Sentry stack trace from a production system, identify the issue, propose a fix, add test cases, verify the fix, and create a GitHub pull request, the system would progress through several steps involving the different agents to complete it. Here's an outline of the process:

1. Task Manager Agent: The Task Manager Agent receives the new task and breaks it down into subtasks, such as analyzing the stack trace, identifying the issue, proposing a fix, creating test cases, verifying the fix, and creating a GitHub pull request. It adds these subtasks to the task list and prioritizes them according to the current list of tasks.

2. Task Executor Agent: The Task Executor Agent processes the subtasks in the task list one by one, using GPT-4 and the LangChain framework. For example, it would first analyze the Sentry stack trace to understand the error, then reason about the issue and propose a fix for it.

3. Memory Manager Agent: The Memory Manager Agent provides the necessary memory and context for the task execution. It might retrieve any relevant information stored in Pinecone, such as previous error logs, similar issues in the past, or any related code changes.

4. Execution Context Agent: The Execution Context Agent interfaces with the external execution environments, such as the application's codebase, APIs, and any required libraries or frameworks. It would access and manage the file system to read and modify the application's code, data, or configuration files, as well as interface with APIs to fetch data or trigger actions based on the task requirements.

5. Task Executor Agent (Continued): With the necessary context, memory, and execution environment, the Task Executor Agent generates the appropriate code and configuration changes for the proposed fix. It would also create new test cases to cover the changes and verify that the fix will solve the identified problem. The system then reasons about why the change is sound, considering factors like code quality, maintainability, and performance.

6. Security and Safety Agent: Throughout the process, the Security and Safety Agent monitors and filters the content generated by the system to ensure that the implementation adheres to ethical and safety guidelines, as well as adhering to any data privacy and security measures necessary for protecting sensitive information.

7. Task Executor Agent (Final Step): Once the fix is verified and the system has reasoned about the soundness of the change, the Task Executor Agent creates a GitHub pull request with the proposed changes, providing a detailed description of the issue, the fix, test cases, and the reasoning behind the change.

8. Task Manager Agent (Continued): After the GitHub pull request is created, the Task Manager Agent generates new tasks based on the completed task result, such as monitoring the pull request for reviews, addressing feedback, and merging the changes after approval. These new tasks are prioritized and added to the task list.

The system iteratively works through these steps until the issue is resolved, the fix is verified, and the GitHub pull request is created and monitored for completion.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimers

This is a work in progress and is not intended to be a complete or accurate representation of the system. It is intended to be a high-level overview of the system's capabilities and how it would work in practice. The system is still in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for production use.
